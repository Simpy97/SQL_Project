# SQL_Project


## This Project appears to be a series of tasks related to creating and managing a database for storing information about movies, directors, actors, and movie ratings. The tasks involve defining database schemas, creating tables, adding constraints, inserting data, and performing various SQL queries. Below is a description of each task:

### 1. Create a Database "Movies": I am instructed to create a new database with the name "Movies."

2. Create a "mov" Schema Under "Movies": Within the "Movies" database, create a schema named "mov."

3. Create a "Movie_Director" Table: Under the "mov" schema, create a table named "Movie_Director" with specific attributes, data types, and constraints. This table will store information about movie directors.

4. Create a "Movies" Table: Under the "mov" schema, create a table named "Movies" with specific attributes, data types, and constraints. This table will store information about movies.

5. Create a "Movie_Actor" Table: Under the "mov" schema, create a table named "Movie_Actor" to store information about actors who appear in movies.

6. Create a "Movie_Rating" Table: Under the "mov" schema, create a table named "Movie_Rating" to store ratings and scores for movies.

7. Write SQL Queries: I am instructed to write various SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database, such as listing movies, directors, actors, and ratings, filtering by various criteria, and performing calculations on the data.

8. More SQL Queries: Additional SQL queries are provided to retrieve more complex information, including relationships between movies, actors, directors, and ratings.

9. Create New Tables and Copy Data: You are asked to create new tables and copy data from existing tables into these new tables.

10. Delete Records: Perform record deletion based on specific criteria.

11. Update Records: Modify existing records by updating specific columns.

12. Create Views: Create views to display specific subsets of data from the database.

13. Retrieve Database Information: Execute queries to retrieve information about the database itself, such as listing databases, table sizes, primary and foreign keys, and constraints.

Overall, this project is designed to teach you how to create and manage a database, define schemas and tables, insert and manipulate data, and perform various types of queries to extract meaningful information from the database. It covers a wide range of database management tasks commonly encountered in database administration and development.
